# MNIST Digit Classification – Chapter 3 Practice (Hands-On ML)

This repository contains my practice implementation from **Chapter 3** of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron.  
The chapter focuses on a **classification task** using the **MNIST** dataset (handwritten digits 0–9), and applies basic machine learning models to understand how classification works.

##  Overview

- **Goal:** Classify grayscale 28x28 images of digits into 10 classes (0 to 9)
- **Dataset:** MNIST (provided by `sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml`)
- **Models Used:**
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Cross-validation & Confusion Matrix
- **Evaluation Techniques:**
  - Accuracy score
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Error Analysis using images

---

##  Key Learnings

- How to fetch and visualize MNIST data
- Binary vs. Multiclass classification
- One-vs-One & One-vs-All strategies
- Precision/Recall tradeoff and ROC curves
- Confusion matrix analysis to improve model understanding

---




##  Sample Output

- Confusion Matrix
- Digit examples the model got wrong
- Visual ROC curve and PR curve
